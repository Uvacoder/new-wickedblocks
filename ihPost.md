# Hello beautiful Hunters

## Wicked is back, and more wicked than ever before

### The first time Wicked Templates launched and ended up in 5th place, it was very basic, but because I am very stubborn I kept going, and customers wanted more. So I brought in a co-funder. @gperales

### Gabriel has helped me with the technical part and made Wicked more attractive. He is a software engineer, maker and all of that

## What are the features you may wonder?

### First of all our scaffolding uses gulp to create workflows that make it easier for developers

### The templates are built with

* Tailwind CSS.
* And template engine, Handlebars.
* Next.js
* Alpine.js
* Figma

### Figma files ar available

## Some great features are

* Dark mode All bright templates are also ready styled for dark mode according to user preferences

* Imagemin to put your images on a diet

* Clean and tidy code

### The templates are built with Tailwind CSS utility classes and sorted out with Headwind using the standard settings for consistency

* Twinmacro, blends the magic of Tailwind with the flexibility of css-in-js, available on our Nextjs templates

* Figma, all templates, include the figma files

## The landing pages include the landing for an app and a saas version of them. So you get two stunning landing pages for the price of one

### Our best sellers are Harmony and Monotone

### Monotone is a simple landing page that many loves

### Now there is no need for integration, download, install, fill up with your content and deploy

## Oh boy...! How easy was that, right?

### This time we want to celebrate this growth and give you some stunning discounts
